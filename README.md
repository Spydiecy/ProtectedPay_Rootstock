## üèÜ Hackathon Submission

This project is our submission for the (A)I BUIDL Lab on Rootstock hackathon in the **DeFi and Payments** track.

### How AI Was Used

Throughout the development of ProtectedPay, we extensively leveraged AI tools to accelerate development, solve complex problems, and improve code quality:

- **Smart Contract Development**: AI helped write and optimize our smart contract code for Rootstock's specific requirements
- **Frontend Implementation**: UI components and state management were scaffolded using AI-generated code
- **Blockchain Integration**: AI helped with RPC endpoint configuration and wallet connectivity for Rootstock
- **Bug Resolution**: Complex issues like address checksumming were resolved with AI assistance
- **Documentation**: AI helped generate comprehensive documentation and guides

For a detailed breakdown of our AI usage including specific prompts and workflows, see:
- [AI-prompts.md](./AI-prompts.md) - Complete documentation of our AI-assisted development process

## üöÄ How It Works

ProtectedPay reimagines crypto transfers with a focus on security and simplicity:

1. **Escrow Mechanism**: When you send funds, they're held in a secure smart contract
2. **Recipient Claims**: The recipient actively claims funds to complete transfer
3. **Refund Option**: Senders can refund unclaimed transfers anytime
4. **Identity Simplification**: Use usernames instead of complex addresses
5. **Social Features**: Create group payments with multiple contributors
